        <h1>About Pete & Bas</h1>
        <p>
            Pete & Bas are a British hip hop duo based in London, formed in 2017. <br>
            They are notable for the songs "The Old Estate", "Dents in a Peugeot", and their debut <br>
            single, "Shut Ya Mouth". The duo consists of two rap artists aged in their 70s. They <br>
            released their first single in 2017 with "Shut Ya Mouth". They recorded the song after<br>
            Pete discovered his enjoyment for hip hop when his granddaughter was playing rap music<br>
            on his car radio. He told Bas about it, and they decided that it would be good fun<br>
            to issue it on YouTube. It was an immediate success and went viral, so they continued <br>
            to create new music. They have also done successful gigs and a concert tour in major<br>
            UK cities. They have over 530,000 followers on Instagram. The duo have collaborated <br>
            with several other notable artists. Their single "The Old Estate" features the rapper<br>
            M24, and has a video filmed on an estate in Rotherhithe, and Millwall football stadium,<br>
            which Pete is at least a fan of.
